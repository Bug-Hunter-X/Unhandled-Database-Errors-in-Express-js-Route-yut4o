# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling during database interactions.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that fetches user data from a database but lacks robust error handling.  This can lead to cryptic error messages for clients and potential server crashes.

The solution (`bugSolution.js`) demonstrates how to properly handle errors, providing more informative error messages and preventing unexpected crashes.

## How to Reproduce the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.  (You'll need a database connection configured). 
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Try to access a route with an invalid user ID or simulate a database error.  Observe the generic error message returned.
